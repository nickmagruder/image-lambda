# How-to
- Log-in to AWS console and upload a file to the resizer1000 bucket. A new, resized file will then be created i nthe resizer1000-resized bucket.

# Issues
- I ran into issues with conflicting regions; that certain module were set to US-west and others to US-east. Additionally, the zip file had to be created correctly  in order to work with the function.
